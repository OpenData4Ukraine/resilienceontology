

Thank you very much for your interest in our ontologies.



This dataset consists of three city infrastructure asset ontologies, describing the ground, roads and buried pipes respectively. 
In each of these ontologies, it defines properties and processes of the corresponding asset, as well as how properties and processes affect each other. 

The dataset contains the following 10 files:

- the main ontology files: 
			- GroundOntology.owl
			- RoadOntology.owl
			- PipeOntology.owl

- translations of the relation statements of these ontologies in natural language:
			- ground-property-process-relation-statements.xlsx
			- road-property-process-relation-statements.xlsx
			- pipe-property-process-relation-statements.xlsx

- screenshots of the ontologies opened in Protege (http://protege.stanford.edu): 
			- ground-onto.png
			- road-onto.png
			- pipe-onto.png
 
- feedback-form.xlsx is a form that users can use to suggest a change in the ontologies.
