        rdfs:comment "Four methods to objectively evaluate ride comfort (also referred to as human response to vibration) are used throughout the world today. The ISO 2631 standard is used mainly in Europe and the British standard BS 6841 in the United Kingdom. Germany and Austria use VDI 2057, while average absorbed power or AAP is used by the United States of America and by NATO in the NATO reference mobility model (NRMM). The assessment of Ride Quality is carried out using three Enhanced Longitudinal Profile Variance values, that indicate the level of profile unevenness within wavelength ranges less than or equal to 3m, 10m and 30m.

    Annotations: 
        rdfs:comment "As a loaded wheel passes over a road, the road deflects and the size of the deflection is related to the stiffness and strength of the road layers and subgrade. In the UK, If the maximum deflection measured by a deflectograph with a contact load of 40kN is less than 500microns, the structural condition is sound; if the deflection is greater than 750microns, the structural condition is severe.

In the UK, trunk roads including motorways where design traffic is heavy in relation to the capacity of the layout, and in all cases where Whole Life Value is taken into account, 40 year designs must be included as permitted options. 20 year designs may be appropriate for less heavily trafficked schemes or for major maintenance where other site constraints apply. In England, a ‘Departure from Standard’ must be obtained from the Overseeing Organisation for use of 20 year designs. The design traffic in msa should be obtained from HD 24 (DMRB 7.2.1). [Ref 2]

        rdfs:comment "A general definition of roughness describes those surface characteristics of a pavement that affect vehicle operating costs and the riding quality of that pavement as perceived by the highway user. The deviation of a pavement surface from a true planar surface with characteristic dimensions that affect vehicle dynamics, ride quality, dynamic loads, and drainage, for example, longitudinal profile, transverse profile, and cross slope. The road quality or state of having an uneven or irregular surface, unit: m/km = mm/mm.  For a paved road IRI (International Roughness Index) range of 0-4 m/km associated with a comfortable ride up to 80-100km/h.

Factors that contribute to skid resistance include the tyre pressure, contact area, tread pattern, and rubber composition; the alignment, texture, surface contamination, and characteristics of the road surface; the vehicle speed; and the weather conditions. Skid resistance is not a constant value. It varies with time, climate and traffic.

B roads – roads intended to connect different areas, and to feed traffic between A roads and smaller roads on the network. 3. Classified unnumbered – smaller roads intended to connect together unclassified roads with A and B roads, and often linking a housing estate or a village to the rest of the network. Similar to ‘minor roads’ on an Ordnance Survey map and sometimes known unofficially as C roads. 4. Unclassified – local roads intended for local traffic. The vast majority (60%) of roads in the UK fall within this category.
